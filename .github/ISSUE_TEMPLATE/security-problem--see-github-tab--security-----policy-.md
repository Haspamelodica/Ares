If the security problem relates to a bug that is associated with unexpected behavior or inconvenience or something non-critical is broken, simply report it as a bug, use the bug report template for that.

If what you discovered could be used maliciously or is in another way an actual security vulnerability, please do not make the issue public, but follow the guide for reporting security vulnerabilities here:

Thank you!
